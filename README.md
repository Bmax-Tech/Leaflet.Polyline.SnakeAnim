# Leaflet.Polyline.SnakeAnim

A plugin for [LeafletJS](http://www.leafletjs.com) to make polylines animate into existence.

Animation is time- and distance- based: the more time elapsed into the animation,
the longer the visible length of the polyline.

Also works on layer groups:

Current version works only with Leaflet 1.1 or higher.

### API

#### Methods

New method in both `L.Polyline` and `L.LayerGroup`: `snakeIn()`. Call it to
trigger the animation.

New method in both `L.Polyline` and `L.LayerGroup`: `snakeOut()`. Call it to
trigger the animation. You can call it during the `snakeIn()` animation.

New method in both `L.Polyline` and `L.LayerGroup`: `snakeReset()`. Call it to
stop any animation and bring back polyline.

New method in both `L.Polyline`: `snakeBindMarker()`. Call it to
bind a marker at the head of the snake. You don't need to add this marker as a
layer of your map.

New method in both `L.Polyline`: `snakeUnbindMarker()`. Call it to
remove the marker at the head of the snake.

#### Options

New option in `L.Polyline`: `snakingSpeed`. This is the speed of the animation,
in pixels per second. Pixels refer to the length of the polyline at the current
zoom level.
The default value is `200`.

New option in `L.Polyline`: `followHead`. This is to keep the map centered
on the head.
The default value is `false`.

New option in `L.Polyline`: `hideHeadMarkerOnEnd`. This is to hide the head marker
when destination is reached.
The default value is `true`.

New option in `L.LayerGroup`: `snakingPause`. This is the number of milliseconds
to wait between layers in the group when doing a snaking animation.
The default value is `200`.

New option in `L.LayerGroup`: `snakeRemoveLayers`. This is used to remove layers
when snake tail passes them.
The default value is `true`.

#### Simple examples

```js
let line = L.polyline(latlngs, {snakingSpeed: 200, followHead: false});
line.addTo(map).snakeIn();
// Later, you can use
line.snakeOut();
```

```js
let route = L.layerGroup([
	L.marker(airport1),
	L.polyline([airport1, airport2]),
	L.marker(airport2)
], { snakingPause: 200, snakeRemoveLayers: true });
route.addTo(map).snakeIn();
// Later, you can use
route.snakeOut();
```

When a polyline or layer group is performing the snaking animation, it will
fire `snakeInStart` (head start), `snakeOutStart` (tail start),`snake`,
`snakeInEnd` (head end) and `snakeOutEnd` (tail end) events.
